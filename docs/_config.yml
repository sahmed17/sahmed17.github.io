about:
  - text: >
      My personal mission is to give to society through my passion for innovation and technology. 
      I am always eager to learn, and I often get obsessed with accomplishing tasks â€” the more 
      difficult the better. The time I have spent heavily working on projects alone does not mean 
      I spend any less closely collaborating with stakeholders. I am constantly looking for ways to
      improve myself and help those around me.

      I love exercising my creativity by playing music with my guitar or painting, especially with 
      friends. I also enjoy being active through outdoor activities from hiking to soccer.
